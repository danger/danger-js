Danger on Node, wonder what's going on? see [VISION.md](VISION.md)

*Welcome!*

So, what's the deal? Well, right now Danger JS does the MVP of [the Ruby version](http://danger.systems). You can look at [Git](https://github.com/danger/danger-js/blob/master/source/dsl/GitDSL.js) metadata, or [GitHub](https://github.com/danger/danger-js/blob/master/source/dsl/GitHubDSL.js) metadata on Travis CI.

Danger can fail your build, write a comment on GitHub, edit it as your build changes and then delete it once you've passed review.

To install:

```sh
npm install danger --save-dev
```
Then add a run command to your `Package.json`

```js
"danger": "danger"
```

Then create a `dangerfile.js` in the project root with some rules:

```js
import { danger, fail } from "danger"
const fs = require("fs")

// Make sure there are changelog entries
const hasChangelog = danger.git.modified_files.includes("changelog.md")
if (!hasChangelog) {
  fail("No Changelog changes!")
}

const jsFiles = danger.git.created_files.filter(path => path.endsWith("js"))

// new js files should have `@flow` at the top
const unFlowedFiles = jsFiles.filter(filepath => {
  const content = fs.readFileSync(filepath)
  return !content.includes("@flow")
})

if (unFlowedFiles.length > 0) {
  warn(`These new JS files do not have Flow enabled: ${unFlowedFiles.join(", ")}`)
}
```

Then you add `npm run danger` to the end of your CI run, and Danger will run. Here's [an example](https://github.com/artsy/emission/pull/385). üëç


Notes:

* The `Dangerfile.js` needs to be able to run on node without running through babel right now.
* The shape of the API is [`git`](https://github.com/danger/danger-js/blob/master/source/dsl/git.js) and [`pr`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danger/danger/master/spec/fixtures/github_api/pr_response.json)

#### Running/Testing manually against a repo

If you create an [appropriately scoped temporary api token](http://danger.systems/guides/getting_started.html#setting-up-an-access-token) for your github account, this can be a good way to see if danger is suitable for you before integrating it into your CI system.

You can manually trigger danger against a pull request on the command line by setting the following environmental variables:

```bash
export DANGER_FAKE_CI="YEP"
export DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN='xxxxxxxxxx'  # a github api token
export DANGER_TEST_REPO='username/reponame'
```

Then you can run against a local branch that is attached to a pull-request, by running the following

```bash
git checkout branch-for-pr-1234
DANGER_TEST_PR='1234' npm run danger
```

assuming that your local filesystem matches up to that branch on github, this will be a good approximation of how danger will work when you integrate it into your ci system.

#### This thing is broken, I should help improve it!

Awesommmmee.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/danger/danger-js.git
cd danger-js

# if you don't have have yarn installed
npm install -g yarn

yarn install
```

You can then verify your install by running the tests, and the linters:

``` sh
npm test
npm run lint
npm run flow
```

### Dev Life

We use quite a few semi-bleeding edge features of JS in Danger. Please see the [glossary for an overview](docs/js_glossary.md). Notably Flow, Interfaces, Async/Await and Typealiases.

You'll have a nicer experience as a developer if you use VS Code with Flow enabled, and if you install flow-typed.

``` sh
npm install -g flow-typed
flow-typed install
```

( and maybe `flow-typed install jest`)

Tips:

* You can run the `danger` command globally from your dev build by running `npm run link`.
* If you're using VS Code, press Run to start an example run, should go through most of the process with a debugger attatched. Either use breakpoints, or add `debugger` to get a repl and context.

### What is the TODO?

Check the issues, I try and keep my short term perspective there. Long term is in the [VISION.md](VISION.md).
