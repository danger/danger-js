Danger on Node, wonder what's going on? see [VISION.md](VISION.md)

*Welcome!*

So, what's the deal? Well, right now Danger JS does a lot of the simpler parts of [the Ruby version](http://danger.systems).
You can look at [Git](https://github.com/danger/danger-js/blob/master/source/dsl/GitDSL.ts) metadata, or [GitHub](https://github.com/danger/danger-js/blob/master/source/dsl/GitHubDSL.ts) metadata on Travis CI, Circle CI, Semaphore, Jenkins, Docker Cloud, surf-build, Codeship, Drone, or Buildkite.

Danger can fail your build, write a comment on GitHub, edit it as your PR changes and then delete it once you've passed review. Perfect.

## Getting set up in your Project

```sh
# with yarn
yarn add danger --dev

# or with npm
npm install --save-dev danger
```

If using NPM, add a run command to your `package.json`

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "danger": "danger"  
  }
}
```

Then create a `dangerfile.js` in the project root with some rules:

```js
import { danger, fail, warn } from "danger"
import fs from "fs"

// Make sure there are changelog entries
const hasChangelog = danger.git.modified_files.includes("changelog.md")
if (!hasChangelog) { fail("No Changelog changes!") }

const jsFiles = danger.git.created_files.filter(path => path.endsWith("js"))

// new js files should have `@flow` at the top
const unFlowedFiles = jsFiles.filter(filepath => {
  const content = fs.readFileSync(filepath)
  return !content.includes("@flow")
})

if (unFlowedFiles.length > 0) {
  warn(`These new JS files do not have Flow enabled: ${unFlowedFiles.join(", ")}`)
}
```

You can also write your Dangerfile in TypeScript. Create `dangerfile.ts` in the project root with some rules:

```ts
import { danger, warn } from "danger"
import * as _ from "lodash"

// Request a CHANGELOG entry if not declared #trivial
const hasChangelog = _.includes(danger.git.modified_files, "changelog.md")
const isTrivial = _.includes((danger.github.pr.body + danger.github.pr.title), "#trivial")
if (!hasChangelog && !isTrivial) {
  warn("Please add a changelog entry for your changes.")

  // Politely ask for their name on the entry too
  const changelogDiff = danger.git.diffForFile("changelog.md")
  const contributorName = danger.github.pr.user.login
  if (changelogDiff && _.includes(changelogDiff, contributorName)) {
    warn("Please add your GitHub name to the changelog entry, so we can attribute you correctly.")
  }
}
```

Using [Jest][jest] and TypeScript for testing? You're all set - Danger should be able to use your `jest` config in `package.json` to process and evaulate your `dangerfile.ts`.

Not using Jest on your TypeScript project? You'll need to take the following steps for danger to evaluate your `dangerfile.ts`:

* Install the `ts-jest` package - `yarn add ts-jest --dev`
* Add the following `jest` section to your `package.json`

```json
{
  "jest": {
    "transform": {
      ".(ts|tsx)": "<rootDir>/node_modules/ts-jest/preprocessor.js"
    }
  }
}
```

Then you add `yarn run danger` to the end of your CI run, and Danger will run. Here's [an example](https://github.com/artsy/emission/pull/385). 👍

I'd love PRs adding more.

## Getting set up on CI

For now, to get set up I'd recommend looking at [the setup guide for the Ruby version][setup]. All the environment vars are the exact same between versions.

You will need to create a bot account, and set up CI to run danger.

If you are using Docker Cloud, make sure to set the following blank ENV vars in your `docker-compose.test.yml` file so they are carried forward from the build environment:

```yml
sut:
  build: .
  environment:
    - DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN
    - DOCKER_REPO
    - PULL_REQUEST_URL
    - SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL
```

## Running/Testing manually against a repo

There are two ways to do this:

#### Using `danger pr`

The command `danger pr` expects an argument of a PR url, e.g. `danger pr https://github.com/danger/danger-js/pull/100`.

This will use your local `dangerfile.js` against the metadata of that PR. Danger will then output the results as JSON, instead of on the PR itself.

#### Using `danger`

If you create an [appropriately scoped temporary api token](http://danger.systems/guides/getting_started.html#setting-up-an-access-token) for your github account, this can be a good way to see if danger is suitable for you before integrating it into your CI system.

You can manually trigger danger against a pull request on the command line by setting the following environmental variables:

```bash
export DANGER_FAKE_CI="YEP"
export DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN='xxxxxxxxxx'  # a github api token
export DANGER_TEST_REPO='username/reponame'
```

Then you can run against a local branch that is attached to a pull-request, by running the following

```bash
git checkout branch-for-pr-1234
DANGER_TEST_PR='1234' npm run danger
```

assuming that your local file-system matches up to that branch on github, this will be a good approximation of how danger will work when you integrate it into your CI system.

Note: this will leave a comment on the PR.

## Advice

* You can have Danger read build logs if you use [tee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_(command)) in your CI process: `yarn run lint | tee linter_output.txt`. This can then be picked up with `readFileSync` at `linter_output.txt` in your Dangerfile later.

## Known issues

* Codeship support does not support fork to fork GitHub PRs.

## This thing is broken, I should help improve it!

Awesommmmee.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/danger/danger-js.git
cd danger-js

# if you don't have yarn installed
npm install -g yarn

yarn install
```

You can then verify your install by running the tests, and the linters:

``` sh
yarn test
yarn lint
```

### Dev Life

Tips:

* You can run the `danger` command globally from your dev build by running `yarn run link`.
* If you're using VS Code, press Run to start an example run, should go through most of the process with a debugger attached. Either use breakpoints, or add `debugger` to get a repl and context.

### What is the TODO?

Check the issues, I try and keep my short term perspective there. Long term is in the [VISION.md](VISION.md).

## License, Contributor's Guidelines and Code of Conduct

We try to keep as much discussion as possible in GitHub issues, but also have a pretty inactive Slack --- if you'd like an invite, ping [@Orta](https://twitter.com/orta/) a DM on Twitter with your email. It's mostly interesting if you want to stay on top of Danger without all the emails from GitHub.
