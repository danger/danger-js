### 0.14.0

* TypeScript Dangerfiles are now support in Danger - orta

  We use TypeScript in Danger, and a lot of my work in Artsy now uses TypeScript (see: [JS2017 at Artsy](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#TypeScrip1t)), so I wanted to
  explore using TypeScript in Dangerfiles.

  This is built on top of Jest's custom transformers, so if you are already using Jest with TypeScript, then
  you can change the `dangerfile.js` to `dangerfile.ts` and nothing should need changing ( except that you might have
  new warnings/errors ) (_note:_ in changing this for Danger, I had to also add the `dangerfile.ts` to the `"exclude"`
  section of the `tsconfig.json` so that it didn't change the project's root folder.)

  This repo is now using both a babel Dangerfile (running on Circle CI) and a TypeScript one (running on Travis) to
  ensure that we don't accidentally break either.

* Created a new `danger.d.ts` for VS Code users to get auto-completion etc - orta
* Added a two new `git` DSL functions: `git.JSONDiffForFile(filename)` and `git.JSONPatchForFile(filename)`.

  * `git.JSONPatchForFile`

    This will generate a rfc6902 JSON patch between two files inside your repo. These patch files are useful as a standard, but are pretty tricky to work with in something like a Dangerfile, where rule terseness takes priority.

  * `git.JSONDiffForFile`

    This uses `JSONPatchForFile` to generate an object that represents all changes inside a Dangerfile as a single object, with keys for the changed paths. For example with a change like this:

    ```diff
    {
      "dependencies": {
        "babel-polyfill": "^6.20.0",
     +  "chalk": "^1.1.1",
        "commander": "^2.9.0",
        "debug": "^2.6.0"
      },
    }
    ```

    You could become aware of what has changed with a Dangerfile in a `schedule`'d function like:

    ```js
    const packageDiff = await git.JSONDiffForFile("package.json")
    if (packageDiff.dependencies) {
      const deps = packageDiff.dependencies

      deps.added   // ["chalk"],
      deps.removed // []
      deps.after   // { "babel-polyfill": "^6.20.0", "chalk": "^1.1.1", "commander": "^2.9.0", "debug": "^2.6.0" }
      deps.before  // { "babel-polyfill": "^6.20.0", "commander": "^2.9.0", "debug": "^2.6.0" }
    }
    ```
    The keys: `added` and `removed` only exist on the object if:

    * `before` and `after` are both objects - in which case `added` and `removed` are the added or removed keys
    * `before` and `after` are both arrays - in which case `added` and `removed` are the added or removed values

* Exposed all global functions ( like `warn`, `fail`, `git`, `schedule`, ... ) on the `danger` object. - orta

  This is specifically to simplify building library code. It should not affect end-users. If you want to
  look at making a Danger JS Plugin, I'd recommend exposing a function which takes the `danger` object and working from that. If you're interested, there is an active discussion on plugin support in the DangerJS issues.

* Improves messaging to the terminal - orta
* Adds the ability to not have Danger post to GitHub via a flag: `danger run --text-only` - orta
* Fix a crasher with `prs.find` #181 - orta

### 0.13.0

* Add `danger.utils` DSL, which includes `danger.utils.href()` and `danger.utils.sentence()` - macklinu

  We were finding that a lot of Dangerfiles needed similar functions, so we've added a `utils` object
  to offer functions that are going to be used across the board. If you can think of more
  functions you use, we'd love to add them. Ideally you shouldn't need to use anything but Danger + utils
  to write your Dangerfiles.

  ```js
  danger.utils.href("http://danger.systems", "Danger") // <a href="http://danger.systems">Danger</a>
  danger.utils.sentence(["A", "B", "C"]) // "A, B and C"
  ```

* Adds `danger.github.utils` - which currently has only one function: `fileLinks` - orta

  Most of the time people are working with a list of files (e.g. modified, or created) and then
  want to present clickable links to those. As the logic to figure the URLs is very GitHub specific,
  we've moved that into it's own object with space to grow.

  ```js
  const files = danger.git.modified_files // ["lib/component/a.ts", "lib/component/b.ts"]
  const links = danger.github.utils.fileLinks(files) // "<a href='...'>a</a> and <a href='...'>b</a>"
  warn(`These files have changes: ${links}`)
  ```

### 0.12.1

* Add support for [Drone](http://readme.drone.io) - gabro

### 0.12.0

* Added support for handling async code in a Dangerfile - deecewan

  This is still a bit of a work in progress, however, there is a new function added to the DSL: `schedule`.

  A Dangerfile is evaluated as a script, and so async code has not worked out of the box. With the `schedule`
  function you can now register a section of code to evaluate across multiple tick cycles.

  `schedule` currently handles two types of arguments, either a promise or a function with a resolve arg.
  Assuming you have a working Babel setup for this inside your project, you can run a Dangerfile like this:

  ```js
  schedule(async () => {
    const thing = await asyncAction()
    if (thing) { warn('After Async Function') }
  });
  ```

  Or if you wanted something simpler,

  ```js
  schedule((resolved) => {
    if (failed) {
      fail("Failed to run")
    }
  })
  ```

* Adds new GitHub DSL elements - deecewan

 - `danger.github.issue` - As a PR is an issue in GitHub terminology, the issue contains a bit more metadata. Mainly labels, so if you want to know what labels are applied to a PR, use `danger.github.issue.labels`
 - `danger.github.reviews` - Find out about your reviews in the new GitHub Reviewer systems,
 - `danger.github.requested_reviewers` - Find out who has been requested to review a PR.

* Updated TypeScript and Jest dependencies - orta
* Add support for Github Enterprise via DANGER_GITHUB_API_BASE_URL env var - mashbourne



### 0.11.3 - 0.11.5

* Internal changes for usage with Peril - orta

* Add `danger pr --repl`, which drops into a Node.js REPL after evaluating the dangerfile - macklinu
* Add support for Codeship - deecewan

### 0.11.0 - 0.11.2

* Add support for [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com) - camacho

### 0.10.1

* Builds which only use markdown now only show the markdown, and no violations table is shown - mxstbr

### 0.10.0

* Adds support for running Danger against a PR locally - orta

The workflow is that you find a PR that exhibits the behavior you'd like Danger to run against,
then edit the local `Dangerfile.js` and run `yarn run danger pr https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/2629`.

This will post the results to your console, instead of on the PR itself.

* Danger changes to your Dangerfile are not persisted after the run - orta
* Add summary comment for danger message - kwonoj
* Add `jest-environment-node` to the Package.json - orta

### 0.9.0

* Adds support for `git.commits` and `github.commits` - orta

  Why two? Well github.commits contains a bunch of github specific metadata ( e.g. GitHub user creds,
  commit comment counts. ) Chances are, you're always going to use `git.commits` however if you
  want more rich data, the GitHub one is available too. Here's an example:

```js
const merges = git.commits.filter(commit => commit.message.include("Merge Master"))
if (merges.length) { fail("Please rebase your PR")}
```

* Support custom dangerfile via `-d` commandline arg - kwonoj
* Allow debug dump output via `DEBUG=danger:*` environment variable - kwonoj
* Adds surf-build ci provider - kwonoj
* Forward environment variables to external module constructor - kwonoj

### 0.8.0

* Support `danger run -ci` to specify external CI provider - kwonoj
* Adds `--verbose` to `danger`, which for now will echo out all the URLs Danger has requested - orta
* Migrate codebase into TypeScript from flow - kwonoj
* Handle removing all sorts  of import types for Danger in the Dangerfile - orta

### 0.7.3-4-5

* A failing network request will raise an error - orta
* Fix Dangerfile parsing which broke due to Peril related changes - orta
* Tweak the npmignore, ship less random stuff to others - orta

### 0.7.2

* Fixes to the shipped Flow/TS definitions - orta
* Adds more functions the the internal Danger GitHub client - orta
* Infrastructure work to allow Peril to run a Dangerfile - orta
* Upgrade outdated ESLint packages - macklinu
* Enhance Windows OS compatibility - kwonoj

### 0.7.1

* Set exit code to 1 when running `danger` throws an error - macklinu
* Add Jenkins CI source - macklinu
* Add .editorconfig - macklinu
* Adds jest-runtime to the dependencies - orta

### 0.7.0

* You can build and run in vscode using your own custom `env/development.env` file. This is useful because you can use the debugger against a real PR. See `env/development.env.example` for syntax.  - orta

* Uses `jest-transform` and `jest-runtime` to eval and apply babel transforms.

  This does two things, makes it feasible to do [hosted-danger](https://github.com/danger/peril) and
  makes it possible to write your Dangerfile in a way that's consistent with the rest of your JavaScript. - orta

* Add tests directory to .npmignore - macklinu
* Update to Jest 18 - macklinu


### 0.6.10

* Brings back the ability to emulate a fake CI run locally via `danger` - orta

### 0.6.9

* Makes `babel-polyfill` a direct dependency, this is because it is actually an implicit dependency in the app. I'm not sure how I feel about this, I guess if we use a part of it in the babel translation of a user's Dangerfile them I'm OK with it. - orta

### 0.6.6 - 0.6.7 - 0.6.8

* Ship flow annotations with the npm module - orta

### 0.6.5

* Adds more node instances to travis - romanki + orta
* Adds support for Semaphore CI - orta

### 0.6.4

* The env vars `DANGER_TEST_REPO` and `DANGER_TEST_PR` will allow you initialize the FakeCI with a repo of your choice. See README.md for more info
* Improved error messaging around not including a `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` in the ENV - nsfmc / orta
* Adds support for getting the diff for a specific file from git: e.g.

```js
// Politely ask for their name on the entry too
const changelogDiff = danger.git.diffForFile("changelog.md")
const contributorName = danger.github.pr.user.login
if (changelogDiff && changelogDiff.indexOf(contributorName) === -1) {
  warn("Please add your GitHub name to the changelog entry, so we can attribute you.")
}
```

### 0.6.3

* Does not break commonmark on GitHub - orta
* upgrades to flow 0.35.0 and fixes associated type errors in covariant/invariant interfaces - nsfmc
* omits flow requirement for new test files - nsfmc
* adds support for circleci - nsfmc
* defines CISource properties in flow as read-only - nsfmc

### 0.5.0

* `danger.pr` -> `danger.github.pr`, I've also created interfaces for them - orta
* `warn`, `message`, `markdown` are all ported over to DangerJS - orta
* Shows a HTML table for Danger message - orta
* Now offers a Flow-typed definition file, it's not shipped to their repo yet, you can make it by `npm run export-flowtype` - orta
* Started turning this into a real project by adding tests - orta

### 0.0.5-0.0.10

* Changes some files casing, added some logs, a bit of error reporting, and verifying everything works through npm - orta

### 0.0.4

* Danger edit an existing post, and delete it when it's not relevant - orta

### 0.0.3

* Danger will post a comment on a GitHub PR with any Fails - orta

### 0.0.2

OK, first usable for others version. Only supports GitHub and Travis CI.

You can run by doing:

```sh
danger
```

Make sure you set a `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` on your CI - [see the Ruby guide](http://danger.systems/guides/getting_started.html#setting-up-danger-to-run-on-your-ci) for that.

Then you can make a `dangerfile.js` (has to be lowercase, deal with it.) It has access to a whopping 2 DSL attributes.

```sh
pr
git
fail(message: string)
```

`pr` _probably_ won't be sticking around for the long run, but if you're using a `0.0.2` release, you should be OK with that. It's the full metadata of the PR, so [this JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danger/danger/master/spec/fixtures/github_api/pr_response.json).
`git` currently has:

```sh
git.modified_file
git.created_files
git.deleted_files
```

which are string arrays of files.

`fail(message: string)` will let you raise an error, and will make the process return 1 after the parsing has finished.

Overall: your Dangerfile should look something like:

```js
import { danger } from "danger"

const hasChangelog = danger.git.modified_files.includes("changelog.md")
if (!hasChangelog) {
  fail("No Changelog changes!")
}
```

That should do ya. I think. This doesn't support babel, and I haven't explored using other modules etc, so...

./

### 0.0.1

Not usable for others, only stubs of classes etc. - orta
